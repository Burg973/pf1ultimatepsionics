Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.</p>\n<p><em>Lingering Aura: </em>A psionic aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of a psionic item). If detect psionics is manifested and directed at such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).
